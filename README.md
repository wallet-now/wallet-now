### Wallet Now

[Wallet Now](https://walletnow.net) is a DeFi & Crypto data aggregator for the Binance Smart Chain.

This repository contains the source-code of our smart contracts and it is also used to track:
 - Our public roadmap (what are we working on right now?)
 - Issues (open an issue if you have a problem with Wallet Now)
 - Feature requests

The main contract addresses are:
* **Proxy** - [0x9091a75f1241c9dd5de852bdaa64af4b651d74d6](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9091a75f1241c9dd5de852bdaa64af4b651d74d6)
* **WalletNow_V1** - [0x181f1b764d16a884890337a33c091ebf6c0e0e88](https://bscscan.com/address/0x181f1b764d16a884890337a33c091ebf6c0e0e88)

To interface with our contracts you need to use the ABI of WalletNow_V1 at the address of the Proxy.
